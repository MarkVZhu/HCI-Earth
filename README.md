## Guide
Unreal Engine 4 version: 4.27  
If you want to examine the scripts of the game, you can find Blueprint programs in Content/BP, Content/UMG, and the Level Blueprint of HCIEARTH.umap.  

## Desciption
Due to limited space, I only describe one important part of the program sample in this project. The Level Blueprint of HCIEARTH.umap implements the voice recognition function of the project. It uploads the voice clip recorded by the user and then gets the result with an external API. The program would react according to the voice recognition result. To know more details, please read the documentation of this project.
